# Dagger2 Example

Dagger is a fully static, compile-time dependency injection framework for both Java and Android. It is an adaptation of an earlier version created by Square and now maintained by Google.
Dagger aims to address many of the development and performance issues that have plagued reflection-based solutions. 

# Installation
